title: Solving my own needs with code
summary: Being able to solve my own needs it's the best of being a developer. I'm doing it almost since day one, but it's now when I realise it's paying off 
---

I remember joining the web development studies as a way to craft something with computers. Something that 
is world-wide used every day. Some of my friends were telling me to join native programming or mobile apps, as 
I'd be able to make apps even for myself if needed. And I remember thinking:

> I can do things for myself on the web, can I?

I started web development because I liked it back in 2012, I knew it even before writing a single line of code. 
I'm happy with my current job and I'm working on some side projects at home too. Sometimes I do it to be on the 
edge checking out new frameworks, features, packages... But the most part of the time when I write code at home 
it's for my own use. Don't get me wrong, I also try to help other people with those projects if it's possible.

My biggest pay off for now, without any doubt, is a [chatbot I use every day to know if I'll find a bike in the 
city bike system I live, in Girona](https://github.com/Lloople/bot-girocleta). I was tired of waking up, walking to the 
bikes station, realising there's not a single one available for me and walking back to the next station undoing the path.

This bot is used by 5 more users by now and is open to everyone who wants to use it. I'm thinking about talking about 
it with more people and users I could find on the stations getting a bike.

I also developed a [chatbot for getting control about your debts with friends](https://github.com/Lloople/bot-mr-debts). 
You only need to add it to the chat groug you have with your friends and say things like `@friend owes me 100` or 
`I owe 100 to @friend`. The idea came when we wanted to register our debts but couldn't decide which app to use that 
works for both Android and iOS. We ended up finding an app, but I decided to build this chatbot anyways as an exercise 
for myself.

Many years ago I built my own CMS (like a lot of people out there) as an experiment, and it resulted in a pretty neat 
tool I used to build a few websites with it and even gain some money.

I already mentioned this at the end of [this previous post](https://davidllop.com/creating-a-chatbot-with-botman), but 
Matt Stauffer gave a talk at Laracon Online 2018 about this topic which I found pretty interesting and it encouraged me 
to continue doing this, for the major good and my own.
