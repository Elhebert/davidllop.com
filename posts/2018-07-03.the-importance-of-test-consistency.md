title: The importance of test consistency
summary: As an amateur test writer, I'm facing a common bug related to dates.
---
Recently I've discovered the benefits of including feature and unit tests in your application which helps me search bugs faster.

On the other hand, I found a small bug today in one of my largest test suite that I was unware of till today.

This test suite contains many tests that work with dates, like hotel bookings or daily price changes. I discovered the issue today when the month changed from June to July, let me explain that.

The user needs to be able to modify the price each week but only on certain days, for example every weekend of September. So the code receives a `date_begin`, a `date_end` and an array of `weekdays`. This is the test:

```php
/** @test */
public function only_weekdays_selected_are_created()
{

    $dateBegin = Carbon::now()->addMonth()->firstOfMonth(Carbon::MONDAY);
    $dateEnd = Carbon::now()->addMonth()->firstOfMonth(Carbon::FRIDAY);
    $weekdays = ['wed'];

    // Act phase of your test
    
    $this->assertDatabaseHas('price_days', [
        'day' => Carbon::now()->addMonth()->firstOfMonth(Carbon::WEDNESDAY)->format('Y-m-d')
    ]);
}

```

Have you spotted the bug already? Well, I'll write it down anyway to force myself to remember it.

1st August 2018 is Wednesday. So the code is inserting the first Wednesday of the first *complete week* into database, which is 8th August 2018, and the assertion is checking for the first Wednesday, 1st August.

After refactoring a bit, the issue is resolved but it forced me to handle this kind of assertions from another point of view. Since we are a small team of developers, and all of us needs to write tests on this project, I thought about creating some kind of `helper` (this word is used so easy lately in programming don't you think?) to handle that date-stuff for us.

I decided to create a class inside the tests folder and call it `TestCarbon`. This name is nothing close to definitive by the way, but is the first thing that came into my mind since it's only for testing and it's related to Carbon.

And this class looks very close to this:

```php

namespace Tests;

class TestCarbon
{

	public function today()
	{
	    return Carbon::now();
	}
	
	public function firstMondayOfNextMonth()
	{
		return self::today()->addMonth()->firstOfMonth(Carbon::MONDAY);
	}
	
	public function firstWednesdayOfNextMonth()
	{
		return self::firstMondayOfNextMonth()->addDays(2);
	}
	
	public function firstFridayOfNextMonth()
	{
		return self::firstMondayOfNextMonth()->addDays(4);
	}

}
```

Then the code of the tests looks like this:

```php
/** @test */
public function only_weekdays_selected_are_created()
{

    $dateBegin = TestCarbon::firstMondayOfNextMonth()
    $dateEnd = TestCarbon::firstFridayOfNextMonth();
    $weekdays = ['wed'];

    // Act phase of your test
    
    $this->assertDatabaseHas('price_days', [
        'day' => TestCarbon::firstWednesdayOfNextMonth()->format('Y-m-d')
    ]);
}

```

I showed the code to the team and they thought it was a good addition to our test suite. They started to use it with their own tests and adding methods for returning the dates they use the most. It turned out to me that I had a bunch of test with similar dates but not the same game used with `monday-friday = Wednesday` but with this class in mind, instead of creating new methods for new days I switched those tests to match this dates and they're still passing.

Later, thinking about this problem I remembered the [Magic string problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_string) and I remembered an app in which I have a few tests interacting with string like there's no tomorrow. It was about colours and they were passed through the request like `yellow`, `green`, `orange`... This time though, while I was creating this `TestColors` class into this test suite, I realised and thought

> why I'm not using this for the main app too?

So I moved that class to a folder freely named `helpers` and refactored the code in the app and in the tests to use this class which contains a bunch of `const YELLOW = 'yellow';` and it's used like `Colors::YELLOW`.
