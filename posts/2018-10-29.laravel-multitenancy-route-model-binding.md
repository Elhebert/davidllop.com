title: "Laravel Multitenancy: Route Model Binding"
summary: This time we will learn how to increment our app security when using Laravel's top feature Route Model Binding in a multitenancy project.

Why write code like this

```php
public function edit($articleId)
{
    $article = Article::findOrFail($articleId);
 
    return view('articles.edit', compact('article')); 
}
```

When you can simply do 

```php
public function edit(Article $article)
{
    return view('articles.edit', compact('article'));
}
```

I'm a huge fan of [this Laravel feature](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/routing#route-model-binding) since I discovered it. You just need to typehint the model in the function
declaration and the framework will handle the `findOrFail` for you. That's it.

But it has a problem though, sometimes you need to check for other fields. 

Using our previous example:

```php
public function edit($articleId)
{
    $article = Article::where('tenant_id', auth()->user()->tenant_id)->findOrFail($articleId);
    
    return view('articles.edit', compact('article'));
}
```

Would look cleaner than 

```php
public function edit(Article $article)
{
    abort_unless($article->tenant_id === auth()->user()->tenant_id);
    
    return view('articles.edit', compact('article'));
}
```

This is a common scenario. You have an app to edit articles, and you have to prevent your users to edit other
users's articles. Basic security rule. But you don't like that kind of code you need to read twice to understand what it does at a first glance.

Well, you could use [Global Scopes](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/eloquent#global-scopes) for sure, but they have a problem: a global scope will be applied to all the queries on
that model, no matter where in the app they occur. So when you need to query all the articles for some statistics or maintenance,
you will need to add `withoutGlobalScope` to that query every single time.

The solution my team and I found was to override the default behaviour of Route Model Binding. Of course Laravel offers you
a simple solution, you just have to override a method in your model to have it up and running.

This is the default behaviour:

```php
/**
 * Retrieve the model for a bound value.
 *
 * @param  mixed  $value
 * @return \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model|null
 */
public function resolveRouteBinding($value)
{
    return $this->where($this->getRouteKeyName(), $value)->first();
}
```

And this is what we will need to declare in our `Article` model:

```php
/**
 * Retrieve the model for a bound value.
 *
 * @param  mixed  $value
 * @return \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model|null
 */
public function resolveRouteBinding($value)
{
    return $this->where($this->getRouteKeyName(), $value)
        ->where('tenant_id', auth()->user()->tenant_id)
        ->first();
}
```

I know what you're about to say

> But David, it's easy to understand what the code does if we check this in the controller

Yeah sure, I'll not do this for every kind of filtering like reedeming a `PromoCode` with an expiration date. But when you
have a multitenancy app this kind of delegation is appreciated. 

I'm with the philosophy of:

> A Controller should receive only Entities which it can work without checking conditionals.

I apply this rule also for `Request` validation using [Form Requests](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/validation#form-request-validation).
You'll find times in which this rule cannot be applied due to some sort of complicated and arcane checks, of course, but
that's what programming is about ðŸ™‚.
