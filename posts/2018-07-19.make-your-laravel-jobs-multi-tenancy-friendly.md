title: Make your Laravel Jobs multi-tenancy friendly
summary: Don't be afraid to extend the core to fit your project needs. That's a very important lesson that took me too long to learn.
---

Our team is working hard in a project which can connect to different databases depending on the client.
In words of Wikipedia's article about [multi-tenancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy):

> The term "software multitenancy" refers to a software architecture in which a single instance of 
software runs on a server and serves multiple tenants.

So the point here is that we have a single installation of our app, and depending on the user logged in it
will show different data.

When you send a Job into a Queue, Laravel serializes the class to save it in your chosen driver until a Worker can fire it.
When the job is fired, it tries to restore the models you passed in the constructor from the database using 
the `SerializesModel` trait.

This works totally fine, but sometimes happen that you have specifications out of common cases, and this time was our turn.

We don't have a connection defined for each client in `config/databases.php` configuration file. Instead, we have 
the database name in a `clients` table with other information, and each `User` has a `client_id` to make the relation. 
Common scenario so far. We use a middleware at the beginning of each request to set the connection attributes 
on the configuration. 

The problem began when we started to work with Jobs, since there's no client logged in to determine
the connection to be configured. After an intense research and digging through the framework's code we figured out a 
solution which fits our needs.

I'm going to show examples with the `database` driver since it's the one we chose for our app. But I'm pretty sure you can
apply the same modifications to the driver of your choice.

Our goal here is that each job can set up the connection it needs, so the jobs must know which client fired it. 
In other words, to which client it belongs.

This step is easy for us since we use the database driver, just need to run the command

```
php artisan queue:table
```

And then modify the migration file before running it to add our `client_id`

```php
Schema::create('jobs', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->bigIncrements('id');
    $table->string('queue')->index();
    $table->integer('client_id')->unsigned()->nullable();
    ...
});
```

But how will know the framework how to fill up this new field when dispatching a new job? Here begins the tricky part.

In our `config/app.php`, we need to specify our custom `QueueServiceProvider` instead of `Illuminate`'s:

```php
'providers' => [
    ...
    Illuminate\Pipeline\PipelineServiceProvider::class,
    App\Queue\QueueServiceProvider::class,
    Illuminate\Redis\RedisServiceProvider::class,
    ...
```

> From now on, we will organize our Illuminate's Queue extended classes into `App\Queues` namespace

This provider is very simple, it just needs to extends the original one.

```php
namespace App\Queue;

use App\Queue\Connectors\DatabaseConnector;

class QueueServiceProvider extends \Illuminate\Queue\QueueServiceProvider
{
    protected function registerDatabaseConnector($manager)
    {
        $manager->addConnector('database', function () {
            return new DatabaseConnector($this->app['db']);
        });
    }
}
``` 

We just need to override the method to register the `DatabaseConnector` in order to be able to use our own, which overrides
the method `connect` to use our `DatabaseQueue`


```php
namespace App\Queue\Connectors;

use App\Queue\DatabaseQueue;

class DatabaseConnector extends \Illuminate\Queue\Connectors\DatabaseConnector
{

    public function connect(array $config)
    {
        return new DatabaseQueue(
            $this->connections->connection($config['connection'] ?? null),
            $config['table'],
            $config['queue'],
            $config['retry_after'] ?? 60
        );
    }
}
```

Now we need to override the method `buildDatabaseRecord` to check if we have a client, and if it is, 
fill up that field on the `jobs` table.

```php
namespace App\Queue;

use App\Queue\Jobs\DatabaseJob;

class DatabaseQueue extends \Illuminate\Queue\DatabaseQueue
{

    protected function buildDatabaseRecord($queue, $payload, $availableAt, $attempts = 0)
    {
        $queueRecord = [
            'queue' => $queue,
            'attempts' => $attempts,
            'reserved_at' => null,
            'available_at' => $availableAt,
            'created_at' => $this->currentTime(),
            'payload' => $payload,
        ];

        if (client()) {
            $queueRecord['client_id'] = client()->id;
        }

        return $queueRecord;
    }
}
```

Okay, so now our jobs have a `client_id` assigned, the only remaining thing is... How to set up the client connection before a job is fired? Yes, you guessed it, we will
need to extend another Illuminate class for that

```php
namespace App\Queue\Jobs;

use App\Models\Client;
use App\Helpers\ClientConnector;

class DatabaseJob extends \Illuminate\Queue\Jobs\DatabaseJob
{
    public function fire()
    {
        if ($this->job->client_id) {
            $client = Client::findOrFail($this->job->client_id);

            ClientConnector::connectByClient($client);
        }

        parent::fire();
    }
}
```

Last remaining thing, we need to come back to our own `DatabaseQueue` and tell it to use our `DatabaseJob` instead
of Illuminate's Queue default by overriding the method `marshalJob`

```php
protected function marshalJob($queue, $job)
{
    $job = $this->markJobAsReserved($job);

    return new DatabaseJob(
        $this->container, $this, $job, $this->connectionName, $queue
    );
}
```
